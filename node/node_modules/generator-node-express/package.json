He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*\n\n\nTo install Yeoman you will need to have npm (node packaged modules) installed. It comes with <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Node</a>. You can install Node by using the downloader or through <a href=\"http://brew.sh/\" target=\"_blank\">Brew</a>. I like Brew. If you use Brew you'll need to add this to your .bash_profile. \n\n```\nhomebrew=/usr/local/share/npm/bin\n```\n\nHere is a post on <a href=\"http://www.lukelarsen.com/post/02-installing-node\" target=\"_blank\">installing Node</a> if you need it.\n\nOnce Node is installed you'll have access to npm so you can use this to install Yeoman.\n\n\n```\n$ npm install -g yo\n```\n\nThe -g means that you are installing Yeoman globally. If you wish to uninstall Yeoman you can do so with this command.\n\n```\n$ npm uninstall -g yo\n```\n\n### What's included in this generator\n\nThis generator uses some tools I find useful. Those include:\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Express.js</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://github.com/ericf/express3-handlebars\" target=\"_blank\">Express3-Handlebars</a> for templating</li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sass</a> for styling</li>\n    <li>Javascript linting</li>\n    <li>It will open your project in your editor of choice</li>\n    <li>It will open your project in a browser of your choice</li>\n    <li>It will watch for changes to your files and recompile or restart the server if needed.</li>\n    <li>Uses <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">LiveReload</a> to refresh the browser when saving</li>\n    <li>It will build a production version of your app when you are ready to deploy</li>\n    <li>It comes ready to deploy to <a href=\"http://heroku.com\" target=\"_blank\">Heroku</a></li>\n</ul>\n\nOptional tools\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"http://inuitcss.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Inuit.css</a> - A powerful designless Sass framework</li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://bourbon.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Bourbon</a> - Sass mixin library</li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://angularjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Angular</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://jquery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">jQuery</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n### Installing this generator\n\nWith Node and npm installed run this to install.\n\n```\n$ npm install -g generator-node-express\n```\n\n\n### Using this generator\n\nWith the generator installed it is time to run it. Create a directory on your computer somewhere and cd into it via the terminal. Then run:\n\n```\n$ yo node-express\n```\n\nYeoman will ask you some questions. Answer them and it will install stuff based on your answers.\n\nOnce Yeoman is done setting up your project run this command to start working on it.\n\n```\n$ grunt workon\n```\n\nThis starts the server, launches the project in your editor, opens the project in a browser, and starts watching the project for changes.\n\n<h4>LiveReload</h4>\n\nTo enable LiveRelaod you'll need to install the Chrome extension.\n\n<a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei\" target=\"_blank\">Live Reload Chrome extension</a>\n\nOnce installed and the project is running just turn on the Chrome Extension.\n\n\n<h4>Restarting the server</h4>\n\nWhen you edit files that need the server to restart for you to see the changes, most of the time Grunt will just restart it for you. There are times when it gets stuck though. If this happens you can run this command to start it back up without reopening the project in your editor and browser.\n\n```\n$ grunt restart\n```\n\n<h4>Generate a production version of your app</h4>\n\nOnce your app is ready for production run this to generate a production build of your project.\n\n```\n$ grunt build\n```\n\nTo test to see if the app is using the production version of the app you can shut down the server and start it again in production mode.\n\n```\n$ NODE_ENV=production node app.js\n```\n\nIf it all works you are ready to deploy to Heroku. The Procfile at the root directory is for Heroku. Without it Heroku will choke. To deploy to Heroku you will need a <a href=\"http://heroku.com\" target=\"_blank\">Heorku account</a> and the <a href=\"https://toolbelt.heroku.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Heroku Toolbelt</a> installed.\n\nOnce that is setup use Git to commit and then Heroku to create and deploy.\n\n```\n$ git init\n$ git add .\n$ git commit -m 'init'\n```\n\nCreate the app\n```\nheroku create\n```\n\nDeploy your code\n```\ngit push heroku master\n```\n\nTo ensure that Heroku is setup to use your production settings you'll need to run this:\n\n```\n$ heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production\n```\n\nOpen the project\n```\nheroku open\n```\n\n### Things to do\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Add test driven development.</li>\n</ul>",
